  # Project: 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard


  ## Description:
  This application is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data along with `localStorage` to store persistent data.

  The image below shows a sample of the dashboard.

  ## Contributing:
  I used all of the bootcamp resources to create this application (tutors, learning assistance and classwork.)
  
  ## Known issues:
  Time permitting, I will circle back to this project to hone my bootstrap skills and align the design with the challenge mockups.
